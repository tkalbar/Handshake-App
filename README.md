Handshake-App
=============
Handshake is an Android application that allows users to create public, temporal communication routes while obfuscating their actual communication details. Clients are able to join a route through a pairing token and the availability of the route is entirely determined by the owner. At the moment we support emails, SMS (through Twilio), and native messages through our application.
